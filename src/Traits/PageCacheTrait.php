 * page cache and dynamic page cache. The standard page cache is used for
 * anonymous users without a session, while the dynamic page cache is used for
 * authenticated users and anonymous users with a session (e.g. anonymous users
 * with a shopping cart).

   *     - 'HIT': The page is served from the page cache.
   *     - 'MISS': The page is not currently served from the page cache, but is
   *       cacheable and subsequent requests will be served from cache.
   *     - NULL: The page could not be served from the page cache. This may be
   *       because either the page_cache module is not enabled, the user has a
   *       session, or the page is not cacheable.
   *   - X-Drupal-Dynamic-Cache: the status of the dynamic page cache. One of:
   *     - 'HIT': The page is served from the dynamic page cache.
   *     - 'MISS': The page is not currently served from the page cache, but is
   *       cacheable and subsequent requests will be served from cache.
   *     - 'UNCACHEABLE': The page is uncacheable because it meets one or more
   *       of the conditions as defined in the `auto_placeholder_conditions`
   *       setting in `services.yml`.
   *     - NULL: The page could not be handled by the dynamic page cache. This
   *       can be because of various reasons: the dynamic_page_cache module is
   *       not enabled, the page has a 403 or 404 status, or one of the request
   *       or response policies are not met.
